##################TODO##################
 I made this todo app by using vue and this poc helped me to know vue file structure and flow and i tried to match real project scenario by using components. I also learned form-handling,modifiers,computed properties,custom component events,slots,dynamic components,lifecycle methods. in next poc's i will be using all that knowledge.
